# Open Ecosystem Collective

We are trying to formulate a collective of leading foundations in web3 and cryptocurrency ecosystems. 

The goal and vision of this project is to democratize the data assets that many products are monetizing and extracting value out of side-effecting activities in crypto. Examples are the trade data, price data, commit history, discord activity and other raw data. 

This platform is an open experiment to find ways to incentivize the web3 community to self-organize but also bring value back to the community instead of letting all these data aggregators extract the maximum value out of it.
